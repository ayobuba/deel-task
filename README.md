Here are the step-by-step instructions to set up this Flask application:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository_url>`. Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your repository.

2. **Install Docker**: If you haven't already, install Docker on your machine. You can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

3. **Install Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It's included as part of the Docker Desktop installation on Windows and macOS. For Linux, you can follow the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

4. **Set up environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

```dotenv
POSTGRES_USER=myuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Pa55word
POSTGRES_DB=ips
```

5. **Build the Docker images**: In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project and run the command `docker-compose build`. This command builds the Docker images for your application.

6. **Start the Docker containers**: Run the command `docker-compose up`. This command starts the Docker containers for your application.

7. **Access the application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/reverse`. You should see the reversed IP address of your machine.

Please note that the application is configured to use a PostgreSQL database. The database is automatically created when you start the Docker containers. The application connects to the database using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which is constructed from the `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` environment variables.
